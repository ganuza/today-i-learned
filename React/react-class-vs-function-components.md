| Aspect |	Class Component	| Function Component |
|---|---|---|
Definition |	ES6 JavaScript class that extends React.Component. |	Plain JavaScript function that returns JSX.|
State Management	|Uses this.state and this.setState() to manage state.	|Uses the useState hook to manage state.
Lifecycle Methods	|Has lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.	|Uses hooks like useEffect to manage side effects.
Syntax	|Requires a constructor and this binding for state updates.	|Simpler syntax without this binding or constructors.
Performance	|Slightly more overhead due to class structure.	|More optimized, especially with Reactâ€™s hooks.
Hooks	|Not available.	|Fully supports hooks like useState, useEffect, etc.
Event Handling	|Needs explicit binding of this to class methods.	|No binding needed; functions have lexical this scope.
Reusability	|Difficult to reuse stateful logic between components.	|Easier to reuse logic using custom hooks.
Future of React	|React is moving towards functional components as the standard.	|Function components are recommended for most new projects.

### Key Takeaways
* Function components are now the standard in React development due to their simplicity and improved performance.
* Class components are still supported, but they are mostly used in older codebases.
* Hooks allow function components to manage state and side effects, closing the gap between class and function components.

* Function components with hooks are preferred today, as React is steering towards them for better readability, reusability, and maintainability.
