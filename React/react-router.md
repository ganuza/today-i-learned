#### React Router
* React Router is a standard library in React.js
* It is used for managing and navigating different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA)
* In SPAs, rather than the browser reloading the entire page each time a user navigates, React Router enables a smooth transition between different parts of the application by dynamically changing components without a full-page refresh
* It allows developers to define routes, which specify what component should render when the URL matches a specific path

#### Key Features
* Declarative Routing: You define routes as components, making it easier to visualize and maintain
* Dynamic URL Parameters: Supports dynamic route matching, allowing paths with parameters ( /user/:id)
* Nested Routes: Allows components to have nested routes, enabling complex layouts and page structures
* Browser History Management: Uses the browser history API to keep track of navigation history, allowing back and forward navigation
