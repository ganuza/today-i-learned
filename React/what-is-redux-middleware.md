* Redux middleware allows you to intercept every action sent to the reducer so you can make changes to the action or cancel the action
* Middleware enables features like:
  - handling side effects (like API calls or logging)
  - asynchronous actions (eg, with redux-thunk or redux-saga)
  - logging or debugging actions (eg, redux-logger)

In Summary  
Middleware in Redux:

* Acts as a bridge between action dispatch and reducer.
* Enables side effects, like API calls or logging.
* Makes Redux extensible, allowing custom functionality.
* Can manage asynchronous logic through libraries like redux-thunk.
