### React.js and Angular.js are both popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries for building web applications

### Key Differences
#### 1. Type:
  * React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs). React focuses on teh view layer (UI components) in the MVC architecture
  * Angular.js: A full-fledged JavaScript framework maintained by Google. Angular provides an all-encompassing framework that includes tools for building both the UI and the entire application logic

#### 2. Architecture:
  * React.js: Follows a component-based architecture where the UI is broken into reusable components. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering
  * Angular.js: Based on MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.  It uses a real DOM, which can be slower for large-scale applications

#### 3. Language:
  * React.js: Written in JavaScript with the option to use JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML)
  * Angular.js: Uses JavaScript but later versions of Angular are written in TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript

#### 4. Data Binding:
  * React.js: Uses one-way data binding. The data flows in a single direction, which makes debugging and state management easier.
  * Angular.js: Uses two-way data binding, meaning changes in the UI automatically update the model and vice versa. This can sometimes lead to performance issues in large applications.

#### 5. State Management:
  * React.js: Relies on third-party libraries like Redux or Context API for state management.
  * Angular.js: Has built-in support for managing state via services and dependency injection.

#### 6. Learning Curve:
  * React.js: Easier to learn if you're familiar with JavaScript. Requires learning additional tools like Redux for state management.
  * Angular.js: Steeper learning curve due to its complex features like dependency injection, directives, ans extensive built-in tools.

### Summary
* React.js emphasizes flexibility and composability, making it ideal for applications that need frequent UI updates and custom setups.
* Angular.js provides a complete toolkit for building large applications, but its structure can be overwhelming for beginners
