React components go through three main phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. During each phase, specific lifecycle methods are called to allow the developer to hook into the behavior.

For example, componentDidMount is used for side effects after a component is added to the DOM. Similarly, componentDidUpdate runs after an update to manage side effects based on the new props or state.

With React hooks, most lifecycle methods are replaced by useEffect. For example, fetching data or cleaning up subscriptions can now be handled using useEffect in function components, making the code more concise.
