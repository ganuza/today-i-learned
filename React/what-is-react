* a JavaScript library for building quick and interactive user interfaces
* developed at Facebook
* most popular library for building user interfaces
* at the heart of React applications are components - independent, reusable pieces of the UI, that we compose to build complex user interfaces
* General structure for a component is the name, the state, and the render for the UI
* It keeps in memory the Virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the DOM
* React figures out any changes in elements and then ONLY updates what has changed in the Real DOM
* React REACTS to changes in state by updating the DOM and rerendering
* React only takes care of rendering the view and making sure the view is in sync with the state
