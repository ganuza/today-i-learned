# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining
concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

Today-I-Learned (TIL) is inspired by Thoughbot, TIL is a repository for everyone to share what we have learn today.

This repo has a tool that help you to manage and write down what you learned in scientific way.
